## Variables

### “Subject” is a numeric value representing one of 30 volunteers who provided data for the study.

### “Activity” lists the name of the activity performed by the subject and can have possible values of (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)


## The various measurements have been obtained using the accelerometer and gyroscope on the Samsung Galaxy SII, present on the waist of each subject.

## Refer to the README.txt file in the archive dataset for a detailed explanation of the measurements, and the meaning of the variable names. The tidy version of the dataset here presents the average of all of the measurements (average of the means that have already been calculated, and the average of the standard deviation calculations, aggregated by subject and activity type).

## The run_analysis.R file contains detailed comments that explains how the raw data in the archive data set have been converted into the tidy data set.
